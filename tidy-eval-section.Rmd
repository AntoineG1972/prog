# (PART) Tidy evaluation {-}

# Introduction

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

At some point, you might have realized you were copy-and-pasting the same dplyr code over and over again. For example, the following code uses `group_by()` and `summarize()` to take the mean of different columns from different data sets. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(cty))

diamonds %>% 
  group_by(color) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(carat))

mpg %>% 
  group_by(model) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(hwy))
```

We can write a function to cut down on duplicated code. Here's a first pass:

```{r}
grouped_mean <- function(df, group_var, summary_var) {
  df %>% 
    group_by(group_var) %>% 
    summarize(mean = mean(summary_var))
}
```

`grouped_mean()` takes a tibble and the names of two tibble columns as arguments. 

```{r, error = TRUE}
grouped_mean(mpg, group_var = manufacturer, summary_var = cty)
```

Our function doesn't work because dplyr verbs work differently than many other R functions. In this section, you'll learn exactly what makes dplyr verbs different, as well as a set of techniques that will make functions like `grouped_mean()` work. The underlying idea that makes this all possible is called __tidy evaluation__.

Tidy evaluation is a complicated subject. Luckily, you don't need to understand all the theory or the under-the-hood mechanics to use tidy evaluation. The _Summary_ chapter is a high-level, practical overview of the basic tidy evaluation use-cases. The goal of the chapter is to show you what to do without explaining how it works. The second chapter, _Tidy evaluation_, dives a bit deeper and discusses what's really going on. However, we still can't cover everything there is to know about tidy evaluation.
